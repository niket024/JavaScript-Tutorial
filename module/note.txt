Modules in JavaScript
----------------------
A module is a self-contained piece of code that groups semantically-related variables and functions. 
Modules are not built-in constructs in JavaScript. But the JavaScript Module Pattern provides a way to 
create modules that have well-defined interfaces that are exposed to clients of the module.

An important advantage of modules is that you can modify the internal functionality whenever necessary 
without affecting the rest of your program. This promotes encapsulation and information hiding. 
To define a module in JavaScript, 
you take advantage of anonymous closures by creating an anonymous immediate function.
